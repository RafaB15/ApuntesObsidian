# ¿What is an Operating System?

An operating system (OS) is the layer of software that manages a computer’s resources for its users and their applications. Operating systems run in a wide range of computer systems.

For general-purpose systems, users interact with applications, applications execute in an environment provided by the operating system, and the operating system mediates access to the underlying hardware.

The OS needs to play 3 roles:
- **Referee**: Operating systems manage resources shared between different applications running on the same physical machine. Since the applications share physical resources, the operating system needs to decide which applications gets which resources and when.
	- Resource Allocation
	- Isolation
	- Communication
- **Illusionist**: Operating systems provide an abstraction of physical hardware to simplify application design. They provide the illusion that each program has the computer’s processors entirely to itself.
	- Virtualization provides an application with the illusion of resources that are not physically present.
- **Glue**: Operating systems provide a set of common services that facilitate sharing among applications (e.g. cut and paste, reading a file wrote by other application). OS provide a layer separating applications from hardware input and output (I/O) devices
