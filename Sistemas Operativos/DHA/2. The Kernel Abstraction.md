A central role of operating systems is protection — the isolation of potentially misbehaving applications and users so that they do not corrupt other applications or the operating system itself. It is essential to ensure reliability, security, privacy and fair resource allocation.

Protection is handled by the kernel.
# Kernel

The **kernel** is the lowest level of software running on the system, has full access to all of the machine hardware. The kernel is necessarily trusted to do anything with the hardware. Any other software running on the system is considered untrusted andis run in a restricted environment with less than complete access to the full power of the hardware.

It runs directly on the processor with unlimited rights.
# Process

A process is the execution of an application program with restricted rights; the process is the abstraction for protected execution provided by the operating system kernel. A process needs permission from the operating system kernel before accessing the memory of any other process, before reading or writing to the disk, before changing hardware settings, and so forth. In other words, the operating system kernel mediates and checks each process’s access to hardware.

When we are running the operating system kernel, it can do anything; when we are running an application process on behalf of a user, the process’s behavior is restricted.
## The Process Abstraction

A programmer types code in some high-level language. A compiler converts that code into a sequence of machine instructions and stores those instructions in a file, called the program’s executable image. The compiler also defines any static data the program needs, along with its initial values, and includes them in the executable image.

To run the program, the OS copies the instructions and data from the executable image into physical memory. The OS set aside the memory regions called the execution stack (static) and the heap (dynamic).

Once a program is loaded into memory, the operating system can start it running by setting the stack pointer and jumping to the program’s first instruction.

A process is an instance of a program. Each program can have zero, one or more processes executing it. For each instance of a program, there is a process with its own copy of the program in memory.
The operating system keeps track of the various processes on the computer using a data structure called the process control block, or PCB.

# Dual Mode Operation

The processor has two modes that are selected by a single bit in the processor status register. 
- **User Mode**, where the processor checks each instruction before executing it to verify that it is permitted to be performed by that process.
- **Kernel Mode**: The operating system executes with protection checks turned off
## Privileged Instructions 

These are instructions available in Kernel Mode but not in User Mode. The kernel need them to do its work
- Change privilege levels
- Adjust memory access 
- Disable and enable interrupts

The closest thing that a process in User Mode can do to this is doing a *System Call*, which gives control to the Kernel.

## Memory Protection

To avoid processes accessing memory they are not allowed to most modern processors introduce a level of indirection, called virtual addresses. With virtual addresses, every process’s memory starts at the same place, e.g., zero. Each process thinks that it has the entire machine to itself, although obviously that is not the case in reality. The hardware translates these virtual addresses to physical memory locations. A simple algorithm would be to add the base register to every virtual address so that the process can use virtual addresses starting from zero.

## Timer Interrupts

Almost all computer systems include a device called a hardware timer, which can be set to interrupt the processor after a specified delay (either in time or after some number of instructions have been executed) so that the Kernel can regain control to check if everything is ok and either continue the process or terminate it. 
When the timer interrupt occurs, the hardware transfers control from the user process to the kernel running in kernel mode. Other hardware interrupts, such as to signal the processor that an I/O device has completed its work, likewise transfer control from the user process to the kernel. A timer or other interrupt does not imply that the program has an error; in most cases, after resetting the timer, the operating system resumes execution of the process, setting the mode, program counter and registers back to the values they had immediately before the interrupt occurred. 

# Types of Mode Transfer

## User to Kernel Mode

**Trap**: Any synchronous transfer of control from user mode to the kernel
### Interrupts
An interrupt is an asynchronous signal to the processor that some external event has occurred that may require its attention. As the processor executes instructions, it checks for whether an interrupt has arrived. If so, it completes or stalls any instructions that are in progress. Instead of fetching the next instruction, the processor hardware saves the current execution state and starts executing at a specially designated interrupt handler in the kernel.
For timer interrupts, the handler checks if the current process is being responsive to user input to detect if the process has gone into an infinite loop
Interrupts are also used to inform the kernel of the completion of I/O requests.

### Processor Exceptions
A processor exception is a hardware event caused by user program behavior that causes a transfer of control to the kernel.
A processor exception occurs whenever a process attempts to perform a privileged instruction or accesses memory outside of its own memory region. Other processor exceptions occur when a process divides an integer by zero, accesses a word of memory with a non-aligned address, attempts to write to read-only memory, and so forth. In these cases, the operating system simply halts the process and returns an error code to the user
### System calls
A system call is any procedure provided by the kernel that can be called from user level. 
To the user program, these are called like normal procedures, with parameters and return values. The caller needs to be concerned only with the interface; it does not need to know that the routine is actually being implemented by the kernel. 
When the kernel completes the system call, it resumes user-level execution at the instruction immediately after the trap.

## Kernel to User Mode

### New process
To start a new process, the kernel copies the program into memory, sets the program counter to the first instruction of the process, sets the stack pointer to the base of the user stack, and switches to user mode.
### Resume after an interrupt, processor exception, or system call.
When the kernel finishes handling the request, it resumes execution of the interrupted process.

### Switch to a different process
After an interrupt sometimes the kernel will switch to a different process and change to user mode, saving the information needed to continua with the previous process afterwards.
